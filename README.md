# kibernate

This project aims to provide a solution to the use case where you have HTTP-based services running in a Kubernetes cluster
which have low utilization and you want to save money by shutting them down when they are not in use.

**Please be advised that the current implementation is a proof of concept / MVP / Pre-Alpha that had to be cranked out in very short time
because it was needed for a project. It is not production ready and has not been tested in a real world scenario.**
